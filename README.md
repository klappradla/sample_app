# Ruby on Rails sample_app

My implementation of the sample application from the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org/) by Michael Harl

I implemented the whole application plus some additional exercises and tests. The app is working and all tests are passing.
Used versions:
* Ruby 2.0.0
* Rails 4.0.2

Feel free to use my implementation as reference solution or lookup!
